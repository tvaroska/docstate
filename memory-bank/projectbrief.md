# Project Brief: Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview
A library for managing documents through various processing states and transitions.

## Core Requirements
1. Document state management with a defined state machine
2. Persistent storage of documents with parent-child relationships
3. Document transformation pipeline (download → chunk → embed)
4. Asynchronous processing capabilities
5. Tracking relationships between original documents and their derivatives

## Goals
- Provide a clean API for document processing workflows
- Enable vector embedding of document content for AI/ML applications
- Support document chunking for improved processing
- Maintain document lineage throughout transformations
- Allow flexible querying of documents by state and relationships

## Target Use Cases
- Processing web content for analysis
- Building document embeddings for semantic search
- Document chunking for large document processing
- Creating structured document pipelines with predictable states
