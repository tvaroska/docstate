# Project Brief: Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview
A fully asynchronous library for managing documents through various processing states and transitions using a state machine architecture. DocState provides a clean, structured way to process documents with parent-child relationship tracking and database persistence.

## Core Requirements
1. Document state management with a defined state machine
2. Persistent storage of documents with parent-child relationships
3. Document transformation pipeline (download → chunk → embed)
4. Fully asynchronous processing capabilities
5. Tracking relationships between original documents and their derivatives
6. High-performance operations for large document sets

## Goals
- Provide a clean API for document processing workflows
- Enable vector embedding of document content for AI/ML applications
- Support document chunking for improved processing
- Maintain document lineage throughout transformations
- Allow flexible querying of documents by state and relationships
- Optimize for high-performance with large document sets
- Support streaming for large document handling
- Implement concurrency controls for parallel processing

## Target Use Cases
- Processing web content for analysis
- Building document embeddings for semantic search
- Document chunking for large document processing
- Creating structured document pipelines with predictable states
- Implementing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems
- Handling high-volume document processing efficiently
