# Project Brief: Document State Management Module

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the core requirements and goals for developing a Python module responsible for managing the states of various documents within a system. The module will provide a flexible and extensible framework for defining document types, their associated states, and the transitions between these states, while maintaining version history and document lineage.

## 2. Project Goals
- Create a reusable Python class/module for managing document states.
- Implement a state machine pattern where state transitions are clearly defined.
- Allow for dynamic definition of document types, states, and transition logic via dependency injection.
- Persist document state information in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
- Support branching of document processing paths to allow for experimentation and comparison (e.g., re-chunking or re-embedding a document).
- Maintain version history of documents after state changes.
- Track document lineage and relationships between different versions.
- Support multiple result documents from a single state transition.
- Provide clear interfaces for interacting with the document state management system.

## 3. Core Requirements
- **Document Representation:** Define a standard way to represent a document within the system.
- **State Definition:** Allow defining a list of possible states for each document type (e.g., `url`, `downloaded`, `chunked`, `embedded`).
- **State Transitions:**
    - Implement functions that handle the logic for transitioning a document from one state to another.
    - Use dependency injection to associate specific transition functions with specific document types and state changes.
    - Support transitions that produce multiple result documents.
    - Preserve the pre-transition version of documents.
- **Version History:**
    - Maintain a complete history of document versions after each state change.
    - Store metadata about when and why changes occurred.
    - Allow retrieval of previous document versions.
    - Support comparison between different versions.
- **Document Lineage:**
    - Track relationships between document versions (parent-child relationships).
    - Record which state transitions led to each version.
    - Maintain a graph of document evolution over time.
    - Support querying document ancestry and descendant relationships.
- **Multiple Results Support:**
    - Allow state transitions to produce multiple result documents.
    - Track relationships between input documents and multiple outputs.
    - Support different processing paths for each result document.
- **Persistence:**
    - Store the current state of each document instance in a PostgreSQL database.
    - Utilize SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
    - Persist version history and lineage information.
    - Maintain relationships between multiple result documents.
- **Branching:**
    - Implement functionality to create a new "branch" from an existing document state.
    - Allow processing (e.g., chunking, embedding) to occur independently on different branches.
    - Potentially provide mechanisms to compare results across branches.
- **Interface:** Define clear Python classes and methods for:
    - Creating/registering new document types.
    - Instantiating and managing document instances.
    - Triggering state transitions.
    - Querying document states.
    - Managing branches.
    - Accessing version history.
    - Tracking document lineage.
    - Managing multiple result documents.

## 4. Scope
- **In Scope:**
    - Design and creation of the core document state management Python classes/module.
    - Database schema design for storing document states, versions, and lineage.
    - Implementation of state transition logic mechanism using dependency injection.
    - Implementation of branching functionality.
    - Version history tracking and management.
    - Document lineage tracking system.
    - Support for multiple result documents.
    - Basic persistence layer using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL.
- **Out of Scope:**
    - Specific implementation of state transition *functions* (e.g., the actual download, chunking, or embedding logic). These will be injected.
    - User Interface (UI) development.
    - Advanced comparison logic between branches (beyond basic state tracking).
    - Deployment and infrastructure setup.
    - Complex version merging or conflict resolution.

## 5. Assumptions
- A PostgreSQL database is available.
- SQLAlchemy is the chosen ORM.
- The consumers of this module will provide the specific state transition functions.
- Storage capacity is sufficient for maintaining version history.
- Document lineage tracking won't create significant performance overhead.

## 6. Success Metrics
- The module successfully manages document states according to defined types and transitions.
- State information is correctly persisted and retrieved from the database.
- Version history is maintained accurately for all state changes.
- Document lineage is tracked correctly and queryable.
- Multiple result documents are properly managed and related.
- Branching functionality allows for parallel processing paths from a given state.
- The module is easily extensible for new document types and states.
