# Progress: Document Processing Pipeline

## Current Status: RAG Example Implemented, Advanced Features in Development

The project has progressed from initial design to a robust implementation with all core components implemented and tested. The RAG example demonstrates practical usage with error handling. Focus now is on optimization, real embedding integration, and enhanced documentation.

## What Works
- ✅ Document class with complete data structure and validation
- ✅ DocumentState class with equality and hash implementation
- ✅ Transition class for state transitions
- ✅ DocumentType with state machine definition and final state identification
- ✅ DocStore with SQLAlchemy backend structure (works with both SQLite and PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Parent-child relationship tracking mechanism
- ✅ Basic query capabilities for document retrieval
- ✅ State transition execution via DocStore.next()
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for Document classes
- ✅ Processing functions implementation (download, chunk, embed)
- ✅ Error handling for processing functions with custom error states
- ✅ Integration tests for complete pipeline
- ✅ Complete working example with full pipeline execution
- ✅ Test fixtures for all core components
- ✅ `DocStore.next` updated to accept `List[Document]` input, enabling batch processing
- ✅ Improved field naming with `media_type` instead of `content_type`
- ✅ Dedicated `url` field in Document class
- ✅ RAG example demonstrating real-world usage
- ✅ Error handling for network failures and malformed URLs
- ✅ Batch processing with mixed success/failure handling

## In Progress
- 🔄 Real embedding library integration
- 🔄 Performance optimization for larger document sets
- 🔄 Stream processing for large documents
- 🔄 Comprehensive API documentation
- 🔄 Support for additional document formats

## What's Left to Build
- Real vector embedding integration with proper embedding library (sentence-transformers)
- Advanced query capabilities for complex document retrieval
- Streaming support for large document handling
- Database migration strategy for schema changes
- Additional utility functions for common document operations
- Expanded documentation with detailed examples
- Monitoring system for pipeline execution
- PDF, DOCX and other document format processors

## Known Issues
- 🐛 No explicit handling for very large documents (needs streaming)
- 🐛 Database queries might not be optimized for large document sets
- 🐛 Hash-based embedding in RAG example is a placeholder and not suitable for production

## Next Milestones
1. **Advanced Embeddings & Performance (Current)**
   - Implement real embedding models integration
   - Implement streaming for large document handling
   - Optimize database queries
   - Explore concurrency via `asyncio.gather` in `DocStore.next`

2. **Additional Document Formats (Target: Next Sprint)**
   - PDF processor
   - DOCX processor
   - HTML processor with content extraction

3. **Robustness Improvements (Target: Next Sprint)**
   - Database migration strategy
   - Fault tolerance mechanisms
   - Recovery from failed state transitions
   - Improved logging and monitoring

4. **Documentation & Examples (Ongoing)**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Create usage examples for common scenarios
   - Add inline documentation for complex logic
   - Add RAG integration examples with LLMs
