# Progress: Document Processing Pipeline

## Current Status: Complete Pipeline Implemented, Performance Optimization Underway

The project has progressed from initial design to a fully working implementation with all core components implemented and tested. The processing functions have been implemented with proper error handling. Now the focus is shifting to optimization, advanced embedding integration, and creating more comprehensive documentation.

## What Works
- ✅ Document class with complete data structure and validation
- ✅ DocumentState class with equality and hash implementation
- ✅ Transition class for state transitions
- ✅ DocumentType with state machine definition and final state identification
- ✅ DocStore with SQLite/SQLAlchemy backend structure
- ✅ Parent-child relationship tracking mechanism
- ✅ Basic query capabilities for document retrieval
- ✅ State transition execution via DocStore.next()
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for Document classes
- ✅ Processing functions implementation (download, chunk, embed)
- ✅ Error handling for processing functions
- ✅ Integration tests for complete pipeline
- ✅ Complete working example with full pipeline execution
- ✅ Test fixtures for all core components

## In Progress
- 🔄 Advanced embedding library integration
- 🔄 Performance optimization for larger document sets
- 🔄 Batch processing capabilities
- 🔄 Stream processing for large documents
- 🔄 Comprehensive API documentation

## What's Left to Build
- Real vector embedding integration with proper embedding library
- Advanced query capabilities for complex document retrieval
- Streaming support for large document handling
- Batch processing capabilities for performance
- Database migration strategy for schema changes
- Additional utility functions for common document operations
- Expanded documentation with detailed examples
- Monitoring system for pipeline execution

## Known Issues
- ✅ ~DocumentType.final property implementation is missing~ - Fixed
- ✅ ~Inconsistency between "cmetadata" column and "metadata" field~ - Fixed in DocStore methods
- ✅ ~Syntax errors in samples/embed_pipeline.py~ - Fixed
- ✅ ~Sample code assumes fields that aren't in the Document model~ - Fixed
- ✅ ~Processing functions have stub implementations only~ - Implemented
- ✅ ~No error handling for edge cases in async operations~ - Implemented
- 🐛 Simple character frequency is used as embedding placeholder rather than real embeddings
- 🐛 No explicit handling for very large documents (needs streaming)
- 🐛 Database queries might not be optimized for large document sets
- 🐛 No batch processing capabilities for improved performance

## Next Milestones

   - Connect to an actual embedding service
   - Add vector database integration options

2. **Performance Optimization (Current)**

   - Optimize database queries
   - Add batch processing capabilities

3. **Advanced Pipeline Features (Target: Next Sprint)**
   - Custom pipeline creation utilities
   - Additional transition types
   - Monitoring and logging enhancements

4. **Robustness Improvements (Target: Next Sprint)**
   - Database migration strategy
   - Fault tolerance mechanisms
   - Recovery from failed state transitions

5. **Documentation & Examples (Ongoing)**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Create usage examples for common scenarios
   - Add inline documentation for complex logic
