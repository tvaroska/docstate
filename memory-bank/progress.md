# Progress: Document Processing Pipeline

## Current Status: Performance Optimization Phase

The project has advanced to a mature implementation with all core components and several advanced features in place. The focus has shifted to optimizing performance, implementing streaming support for large documents, and enhancing concurrency controls for high-volume document processing.
