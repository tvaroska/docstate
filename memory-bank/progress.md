# DocState Progress Tracker

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: State Machine Implementation with SQLAlchemy Integration

DocState is currently in the implementation phase with a focus on building the core state machine and integrating with SQLAlchemy ORM. We have established the technology stack (Python 3.12+, SQLAlchemy with Alembic) and are now implementing the core functionality.

## What Works

Implementation has begun with focus on the state machine core:

1. **Technology Stack**: Python 3.12+ with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
2. **Core Architecture**: The state machine architecture has been implemented
3. **SQLAlchemy Models**: Initial database models have been defined
4. **State Transition Registry**: Core mechanism for registering and validating transitions
5. **Basic Transaction Management**: Framework for atomic state transitions

## What's Left to Build

While the core state machine is underway, several components still need to be built:

### 1. State Machine Core
- [x] Base state machine architecture
- [x] State transition registration mechanism
- [ ] StateManager implementation
- [ ] Complete transition validation logic
- [ ] State graph visualization

### 2. SQLAlchemy Integration
- [x] Basic SQLAlchemy models
- [ ] Complete transaction management
- [ ] Alembic migration scripts
- [ ] Query optimization for state filtering
- [ ] State history tracking

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery
- [x] Error state definition framework
- [ ] Automated retry system
- [ ] Backoff strategies
- [ ] Manual intervention APIs
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerting

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Unit test framework setup
- [ ] State machine test fixtures
- [ ] SQLAlchemy test utilities
- [ ] State transition test helpers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for transitions

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Core state machine documentation
- [ ] SQLAlchemy integration guide
- [ ] API reference for state transitions
- [ ] Error handling best practices
- [ ] Migration guides for schema changes

### 6. Python 3.12+ Features
- [x] Type parameter implementation
- [ ] Pattern matching for state logic
- [ ] Self type utilization
- [ ] Improved typing for transition functions

## Known Issues

Several implementation challenges have been encountered:

1. **SQLAlchemy Session Management**: Ensuring proper session handling across state transitions
2. **Alembic Migration Complexity**: Managing schema changes with Alembic requires careful planning
3. **State Graph Validation**: Validating complex state graphs for correctness is challenging
4. **Transaction Isolation**: Ensuring proper isolation levels for concurrent state transitions
5. **Python 3.12 Compatibility**: Some libraries need updates to work with Python 3.12 features
6. **Large Document Performance**: Optimizing SQLAlchemy for large document content requires tuning
7. **Retry Logic Complexity**: Balancing automatic retry with manual intervention needs refinement
