# Active Context: Document Processing Pipeline

## Current Focus
- Implementing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) example usage
- Enhancing error handling for edge cases (network failures, malformed URLs)
- Optimizing database queries for better performance
- Refining batch processing capabilities
- Creating comprehensive API documentation

## Recent Changes
- Implemented Document, DocumentState, DocumentType, and Transition classes
- Developed DocStore with SQLAlchemy for document persistence
- Implemented state machine architecture with DocumentState and Transition classes
- Implemented processing function implementations (download_document, chunk_document, embed_document)
- Built parent-child relationship tracking with proper database updates
- Fixed DocumentType.final property implementation
- Fixed inconsistency between "cmetadata" in database and "metadata" in Document objects
- Added error handling for processing functions
- Created comprehensive unit tests for Document classes
- Created integration tests for the full pipeline
- Implemented a complete pipeline example with working processing functions
- Updated `DocStore.next` method to accept either a single `Document` or `List[Document]` and return `List[Document]`, enabling batch processing
- Updated relevant unit tests for `DocStore.next`
- Renamed `content_type` to `media_type` throughout the codebase for better standards alignment
- Added `url` field to Document class for direct URL storage
- Implemented RAG example with error handling for invalid URLs
- Added extensive error handling tests with custom error states
- Added support for batch processing with mixed success and failure scenarios


## Next Steps
- Add real vector embedding integration using a proper embedding library
- Implement streaming for large document handling
- Optimize database queries for high-volume use cases
- Create more comprehensive API documentation
- Add more examples for custom pipelines
- Develop a monitoring system for pipeline execution
- Add support for additional document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)


## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using SQLAlchemy as the backend with proper database field mappings
- Implemented asynchronous functions for all document processing steps
- DocStore.next() handles metadata/cmetadata conversion properly
- Unit tests validate the complete pipeline functionality
- Currently using placeholder methods for embeddings (hash-based in RAG example)
- Need to determine which embedding library to use for vector embeddings (considering sentence-transformers)
- Investigating streaming options for handling very large documents
- RAG example demonstrates practical usage in real-world scenario
- Error handling now supports custom error states defined at DocStore initialization
