# Active Context: Document Processing Pipeline

## Current Focus
- Improving test coverage for the DocStore.next() method with actual processing
- Refining error handling for edge cases (network failures, large documents)
- Optimizing database queries for better performance
- Adding batch processing capabilities
- Creating comprehensive API documentation

## Recent Changes
- Implemented Document, DocumentState, DocumentType, and Transition classes
- Developed DocStore with SQLAlchemy for document persistence
- Implemented state machine architecture with DocumentState and Transition classes
- Implemented processing function implementations (download_document, chunk_document, embed_document)
- Built parent-child relationship tracking with proper database updates
- Fixed DocumentType.final property implementation
- Fixed inconsistency between "cmetadata" in database and "metadata" in Document objects
- Added error handling for processing functions
- Created comprehensive unit tests for Document classes
- Created integration tests for the full pipeline
- Implemented a complete pipeline example with working processing functions
- Updated `DocStore.next` method to accept either a single `Document` or `List[Document]` and return `List[Document]`, enabling batch processing.
- Updated relevant unit tests for `DocStore.next`.


## Next Steps
- Add real vector embedding integration using a proper embedding library
- Implement streaming for large document handling
- Add batch processing capabilities
- Optimize database queries
- Create more comprehensive API documentation
- Add more examples for custom pipelines
- Develop a monitoring system for pipeline execution


## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using SQLAlchemy as the backend with proper database field mappings
- Implemented asynchronous functions for all document processing steps
- DocStore.next() handles metadata/cmetadata conversion properly
- Unit tests validate the complete pipeline functionality
- Currently using a character frequency-based placeholder for embeddings
- Need to determine which embedding library to use for vector embeddings (considering sentence-transformers)
- Investigating streaming options for handling very large documents
- Planning to add batch processing capabilities for performance optimization
