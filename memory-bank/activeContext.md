# Active Context: Document Processing Pipeline

## Current Focus
- Implementing multiprocessing for CPU-intensive operations
- Optimizing database queries for better performance with large datasets
- Enhancing concurrency controls for parallel processing
- Implementing connection pooling optimizations
- Expanding document format support (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Creating comprehensive API documentation
- Developing monitoring tools for pipeline execution

## Recent Changes
- Implemented multiprocessing for CPU-intensive operations (embedding, chunking)
- Added process pool management with configurable worker count
- Added worker function serialization for cross-process communication
- Modified document processing to intelligently select parallel processing strategy
- Updated RAG example to demonstrate multiprocessing usage
- Renamed main class from DocStore to AsyncDocStore to reflect its fully asynchronous nature
- Implemented Document, DocumentState, DocumentType, and Transition classes with performance optimizations
- Developed AsyncDocStore with SQLAlchemy async extensions for document persistence
- Implemented state machine architecture with proper caching for better performance
- Added comprehensive async processing function implementations with error handling
- Built parent-child relationship tracking with optimized database operations
- Added `add_children` method to Document for efficiently adding multiple children
- Implemented caching in DocumentState and DocumentType for better performance
- Added connection pooling with configurable settings in AsyncDocStore
- Implemented concurrency controls with `gather_with_concurrency` utility
- Added streaming support for large document content with `stream_content` method
- Added batch processing capabilities with `get_batch` method
- Added database indexes and optimized query patterns
- Implemented comprehensive logging utilities
- Created performance monitoring with `@async_timed()` decorator
- Added async context manager support for AsyncDocStore
- Implemented proper cleanup with `dispose()` method
- Added document counting with the `count()` method
- Created a comprehensive RAG example with error handling
- Implemented type validation with Pydantic models

## Next Steps
- Implement streaming for large document handling (in progress)

- Implement concurrency improvements via `asyncio.gather` in `AsyncDocStore.next`
- Create a database migration strategy for schema changes
- Develop performance benchmarks for measuring improvements
- Implement more sophisticated chunking strategies
- Add telemetry and performance metrics collection
- Improve error recovery mechanisms
- Develop handling for network errors and retries
