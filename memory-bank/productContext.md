# Product Context: Document State Management Module

## 1. Problem Statement
Managing the lifecycle and processing steps of documents within complex systems can be challenging. Different document types may require unique processing pipelines (e.g., downloading, cleaning, chunking, embedding). Keeping track of the current state of each document, ensuring correct transitions, and handling errors or variations in processing becomes increasingly difficult as the system scales. Additionally, there's a need to maintain version history, track document lineage, and handle cases where a single processing step might produce multiple output documents. Furthermore, there's often a need to experiment with different processing steps (like trying a new chunking algorithm) without disrupting the main workflow, requiring a way to manage parallel processing paths or "branches". Current ad-hoc solutions lack standardization, persistence, and flexibility.

## 2. Proposed Solution
We propose a dedicated Python module for robust document state management. This module will act as a central coordinator for document lifecycles, leveraging a state machine pattern. Key aspects include:

- **State Machine:** Documents progress through predefined states (e.g., `new`, `downloaded`, `processed`, `embedded`).
- **Configurability:** Document types, their states, and the logic for transitioning between states will be configurable, ideally through dependency injection. This allows the core module to remain generic while supporting diverse processing pipelines.
- **Version History:** Each state change creates a new version of the document, preserving the complete history of changes and enabling retrieval of previous versions.
- **Document Lineage:** The system tracks relationships between document versions, maintaining a graph of how documents evolve through processing steps and branches.
- **Multiple Results:** State transitions can produce multiple output documents, with the system tracking relationships between input and output documents.
- **Persistence:** The state of each document instance, its version history, lineage information, and relationships between documents will be stored reliably in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
- **Branching:** The module will explicitly support creating "branches" from any given state of a document. This enables running alternative processing steps (e.g., different embedding models) in parallel on separate branches originating from the same base document state, facilitating comparison and experimentation.

## 3. How it Works
1. **Define Document Types:** Users define a document type, specifying its unique identifier and the sequence of possible states it can be in (e.g., `WebPageDocument` states: `url_provided` -> `downloaded` -> `content_extracted` -> `chunked` -> `embedded`).
2. **Register Transition Logic:** Users provide Python functions responsible for the actual work of transitioning between states (e.g., a function `download_url(doc_id, url)`). These functions are associated with specific state transitions for a document type via dependency injection.
3. **Instantiate Documents:** New document instances are created within the system, starting at their initial state. Their state is persisted.
4. **Trigger Transitions:** The system (or an external process) triggers state transitions for a document instance. The module:
   - Validates the transition
   - Creates a new version of the document
   - Executes the associated injected function
   - Handles multiple output documents if produced
   - Updates the document lineage graph
   - Persists all changes and relationships
5. **Version Management:** The system maintains a complete history of document versions:
   - Each state change creates a new version
   - Previous versions are preserved and retrievable
   - Metadata about changes is stored (timestamp, reason, etc.)
6. **Lineage Tracking:** The system maintains a graph of document relationships:
   - Parent-child relationships between versions
   - Connections between input and output documents
   - Branch relationships and evolution paths
7. **Branching:** At any point, a user can request to create a branch from a document's current state (e.g., from the `downloaded` state). A new record is created, linked to the original, allowing independent state transitions on this new branch (e.g., applying a different chunking method).
8. **Querying:** Users can query the system for:
   - Current state of any document instance or branch
   - Complete version history of a document
   - Document lineage and relationships
   - Multiple results from processing steps

## 4. User Experience Goals
- **Developers:** 
  - Provide a clear, well-documented, and easy-to-use Python API for integrating document state tracking into their applications
  - Enable straightforward configuration and extension
  - Support handling of multiple output documents from processing steps
- **System Administrators:** 
  - Offer reliable persistence and clear state tracking for monitoring and debugging document processing pipelines
  - Provide tools for managing document versions and lineage
- **Data Scientists/Analysts:** 
  - Enable easy experimentation with different processing steps through the branching mechanism
  - Facilitate comparison of results across different processing paths
  - Support analysis of document evolution and relationships
