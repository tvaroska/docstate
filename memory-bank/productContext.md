# Product Context: Document Processing Pipeline

## Problem Statement
Processing documents for AI and other applications requires multiple steps - downloading, parsing, chunking, and embedding. Without a structured approach, managing the relationships between original documents and their derived chunks/embeddings becomes challenging, especially at scale. Additionally, performance bottlenecks can emerge when processing large document sets or handling large documents.

## Solution
A high-performance, fully asynchronous document processing pipeline library that:
- Treats documents as entities with defined states in a state machine
- Manages transitions between states via explicit async functions
- Tracks parent-child relationships between original documents and derivatives
- Persists document metadata and state in a database with optimized queries
- Provides streaming capabilities for large document handling
- Implements concurrency controls for parallel processing
- Provides a clean API for document retrieval and processing

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive API for defining document processing workflows
- Clear visibility into document states and relationships
- Predictable behavior through explicit state transitions
- Minimal boilerplate code for common document processing tasks
- Flexible storage and retrieval options
- High performance with large document sets
- Efficient handling of large documents through streaming
- Graceful error handling with custom error states

## Key Differentiators
- State machine approach to document processing
- Built-in parent-child relationship tracking
- Database persistence with flexible query capabilities
- Fully asynchronous design for performance at scale
- Vector embedding support for AI/ML applications
- Streaming support for large document handling
- Optimized connection pooling and batch operations
- Concurrency controls for parallel processing
- Comprehensive error handling
